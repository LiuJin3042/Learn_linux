  permissive(the restriction is set to minimum)
>> cd /etc/selinux
>> vi config
>> yum -y install httpd
>> sysctl start httpd
>> sysctl status httpd
>> ifconfig (check the ip addr of the service)
in outer mechine, visit the ip, cannot be reached.
check the firewall in gui
>> firewall-config
in public, services, tick the http service, save
>> cd /var/www/html
>> echo 'welcome' > index.html
visit the web in outer mechine
>> ls -Z(see the tags of files)
user-tag:role-tag:class-tag:sensitive-tag
moving file won't change the tag. 
the file created in /var/www/html have a special class tag for apache service
while the file moved to the folder does not.
we may have trouble visiting the moved file from outer client.
